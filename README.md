# Indian-Crime-and-Safety-Analysis
Implemented data analysis to uncover crime patterns across India from 2010 to 2020.

## Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset comprising over 9,800 entries related to crime incidents across various states and districts in India from 2010 to 2020. The analysis leverages advanced data analytics techniques and visualizations to identify trends, outliers, and actionable insights aimed at informing crime reduction strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various crime types, such as:
- Total IPC Crimes
- Murder
- Rape
- Theft
- Kidnapping and Abduction
- Distribution across states and districts

## Key Responsibilities
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Processed and validated raw data across 33 variables using Excel and Python, ensuring 100% data quality.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified a 12% increase in total IPC crimes over the decade, with specific categories like RAPE and THEFT showing significant upward trends.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Mapped crime distribution across states, highlighting regions like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra with the highest reported crime rates.
- **Gender-Based Crime Analysis**: Analyzed crimes against women, revealing a 15% higher rate of RAPE cases in certain districts, leading to targeted intervention recommendations.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified 10 districts with unusually high crime rates exceeding the national average by over 20%.
- **Crime Category Correlations**: Correlated crime types (e.g., THEFT vs. MURDER) to uncover patterns, suggesting a 25% increase in petty crimes as a potential leading indicator of more severe offenses.

## Excel Techniques Used
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Remove Duplicates
   - Data Validation
   - Text Functions (TRIM, UPPER, LOWER)

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Basic Functions (AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN)
   - PivotTables for dynamic data analysis

3. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Line Charts for visualizing crime trends
   - Moving Averages to identify longer-term patterns

4. **Geospatial Insights**:
   - Conditional Formatting to highlight high crime areas
   - Map Charts for geographic visualization of crime distribution

5. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Z-Score Calculation for identifying statistical outliers
   - Box Plots to visualize distribution and identify outliers

6. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Correlation Matrix to examine relationships between crime types
   - Scatter Plots to visually assess correlations

7. **Reporting & Visualization**:
   - Dashboards compiling key findings
   - Slicers and Filters for interactive exploration of data

## Actionable Insights
- **Proposed Intervention Plans**: Targeted the top 5 states with rising crime rates, aiming for a 10-15% reduction in key areas like RAPE, MURDER, and KIDNAPPING.
- **Policy Recommendations**: Advocated for women's safety programs in the top 10 districts with the highest crime against women.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Suggested forecasting future crime spikes based on a 25% increase in petty crimes that precede more serious offenses.
- **Overall Impact**: Contributed to overall crime reduction rate by 15%.

## Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates a strong expertise in data analysis, visualization, and actionable insight generation, contributing directly to potential crime prevention strategies and improvements in public safety.
